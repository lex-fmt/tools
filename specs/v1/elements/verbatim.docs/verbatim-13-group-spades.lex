This is a groupped Verbatim Block, this is the first Group: 
	$ pwd # always te staring point 
Now that you know where you are, lets find out what's around you: 

	$ ls
	$ ls -r # recursive

And let's go places: 
	$ cd <path to go>

Feeling lost, let's get back home: 
	$ cd ~
:: shell


Note that verbatim blocks conetents can have any number of blank lines, including None.
