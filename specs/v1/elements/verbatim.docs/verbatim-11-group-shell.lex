Installing with home brew is simple:

    $ brew install lex
From there the interactive help is available:

    $ lex help
And the built-in viewer can be used to quickly view the parsing:

    $ lexv <path>
:: shell

This should not stop the content below, correct, from parsing however.

This is block 1:

    $ ls
Which is a shell block:

    $ pwd
:: shell

And this is a block 2:

      input("Favorite fruit:")
:: javascript
