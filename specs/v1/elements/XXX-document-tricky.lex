Trifecta Nesting Test {{paragraph}}

This document tests the combination of all three core elements (sessions, paragraphs, lists) with various levels of nesting. {{paragraph}}

1. Root Session {{session-title}}

    This root session contains various nested elements. {{paragraph}}

    1.1. Sub-session with Paragraph {{session-title}}

        This sub-session starts with a paragraph. {{paragraph}}

        - Then has a list {{list-item}}
        - With multiple items {{list-item}}

    1.2. Sub-session with List {{session-title}}

        - Starts with a list {{list-item}}
        - Has multiple items {{list-item}}

        Then has a paragraph. {{paragraph}}

        1.2.1. Deeply Nested Session {{session-title}}

            This is a deeply nested session. {{paragraph}}

            - With its own list {{list-item}}
            - And multiple items {{list-item}}

            - Another list follows {{list-item}}
            - In the same session {{list-item}}

    Back to the root session level. {{paragraph}}

    - Root session can also have lists {{list-item}}
    - At its own level {{list-item}}

2. Another Root Session {{session-title}}

    This session demonstrates different nesting patterns. {{paragraph}}

    2.1. Mixed Content Sub-session {{session-title}}

        - Starts with list {{list-item}}
        - Multiple items {{list-item}}

        Paragraph in the middle. {{paragraph}}

        - Ends with another list {{list-item}}
        - To complete the pattern {{list-item}}

        2.1.1. Even Deeper Nesting {{session-title}}

            The deepest level contains paragraphs and lists. {{paragraph}}

            - First deep list {{list-item}}
            - Second deep item {{list-item}}

            Another paragraph at deep level. {{paragraph}}

            - Second deep list {{list-item}}
            - Completing the deep structure {{list-item}}

Final root level paragraph. {{paragraph}}
